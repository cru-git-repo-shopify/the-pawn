Attaining Government certification involves more than just buying carbon credits – it’s about reducing a company’s carbon footprint and then offsetting any emissions that can’t be reduced.\n\nRoss Hill Wines is leading the way by not only having the wine business itself certified but by having the actual wine they produce as certified carbon neutral as well. So, when you’re enjoying a Ross Hill wine you are actually doing your bit for the environment. And that’s got to be a great feeling to wash down with a glass of wine!\n\nRoss Hill has long prided itself on a solid environmental policy and has carefully approached all aspects of its wine production process by adopting sustainable principles – from the vineyard to the hands-on winemaking procedures practiced.",
