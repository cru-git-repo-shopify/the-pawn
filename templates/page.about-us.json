But the art of blending is just as at home in the vineyard. Once vintage is completed and the resultant wines begin their journey to your palate in the vineyard I will look back over the events of the season past.</p><p>What I turn my attention to most is the outcome of all the inputs that go into producing fruit worthy of inclusion in a Pawn wine. These inputs are as carefully considered as those in the winery.</p><p>They are the result of not just well made plans and good timing but also the bringing together of years of grapegrowing experience, a fair measure of local knowledge and due consideration to daily observations of vineyard occurrences.</p><p>These observations range from the close attention paid to the vineyards while I’m on my morning constitutional around the ‘block’ with Holly Dog, to the array of scientific data gathered by the assortment of hi-tech monitoring ‘gadgets’ and the meticulous measurements taken during the season.</p><p>From all this and the discussions that follow come the decisions on what needs to go into the vineyard so that at the end of the season the bunches of grapes that arrive at the winery are assured of a place in a bottle of The Pawn.</p><p>To put it all in a grape skin (the vinous equivalent of the ‘in a nutshell’ cliché), if I get the blend right in vineyard and Mother Nature doesn’t bowl me too many bouncers, then we can all rest assured that the quality we expect in every bottle of Pawn is there waiting for us under every cork or screw.</p><p>At Pawn HQ, I had some definite highlights during vintage 2024, one in particular was the white varieties, with the Fiano and Pinot Grigio all being harvested during the cool nights and requiring no additions in the winery – gorgeous balance of acid, sugar and flavour which will see some amaze-ball wines for spring release.</p><p>TK</p>",
